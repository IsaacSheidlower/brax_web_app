    <h2>Tufts University - Consent to Participate in a Research Study</h2>
      <h3>Virtual Agents learning from human interaction</h3>  
    <p>
You are being asked to volunteer in a research study. Please find below information about this research for you to carefully consider when deciding about whether or not to participate. Please e-mail questions about any of the information you do not understand to aabl_participants@cs.tufts.edu before you decide whether to participate.
</p>
<p>
<h4>What is this study about?</h4>
Researchers at Tufts University are conducting a study on virtual agents learning from human interaction. The purpose of this research is to enable a robot to use interaction in order to obtain more useful information from human teachers. You are being asked to participate because you have come to this website. You are one of up to 10,000 participants to take part in this study. Your participation in the study is expected to last fifteen to twenty minutes. The study is supported by Tufts University, who is sponsoring this research. We will discard any records we have of your ID upon the study’s completion.
    </p>
    <p>
<h4>What will happen during this research?</h4>
If you agree to be in this research, your participation will include interacting with one or more virtual agents. The procedure will occur in the following order:
<ol>
  <li>A task will be explained</li>
  <li>You will use an on-screen GUI to interact with the agent, interact with the virtual environment, or provide feedback to the agents indicating their performance at the task.</li>
  <li>The task may be repeated.</li>
</ol>
    </p>
    <p>
<h4>What will you do to protect my privacy?</h4>
The results of the study may be published. We will take measures to protect your privacy and confidentiality including encrypting all data related to your interactions and limiting data access to research team members. We will not collect your name or any other information that could directly identify you. Despite taking steps to protect your privacy, we can never fully guarantee your privacy will be protected. If you tell us something that makes us believe that you or others have been or may be physically harmed, we may report that information to the appropriate agencies. 

Individuals and organizations responsible for conducting or monitoring this research may be permitted access to and inspect the research records. This includes Tufts Social, Behavioral & Educational Research Institutional Review Board (Tufts SBER IRB), Dr. Elaine Short, and research team members.

The interaction data we collect will be retained and could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without your additional informed consent.
    </p>
    <p>
<h4>What are the risks or discomforts associated with this research?</h4>
The risks or discomforts associated with the research are to your privacy. These risks are minimal, as we will not collect any directly identifiable information (e.g. name, location, IP address), but we will collect interaction data that might describe you in some hereto unknowable way. If we had a data breach this interaction data might become public. 
    </p>
    <p>
<h4>How might I benefit from this research?</h4>
There may be no personal benefit from your participation, but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity.
</p>
<p>
<h4>What is the compensation for the research?</h4>
This study is expected to take 15-20 minutes to complete. The interaction itself with take 15 minutes and you will be compensated $3 USD for your participation. Upon completion, the researchers will confirm participation and approve the money to be deposited into your MTurk account. If the study is not completed by the participant, the researchers withhold the right to not provide payment. When the interaction is completed (which will take a maximum of 15 minutes as it is being timed, excluding this consent form and the task explanation), a “thank you” screen will be displayed. Withdrawal prior to that screen being displayed may be considered as an early termination and may result in you not receiving payment.

</p>
<p>
<h4>What will happen if I choose not to participate?</h4>
It is your choice to participate or not to participate in this research. Participation is voluntary. The alternative to participation is not participating. 
</p>
<p>
<h4>Is my participation voluntary, and can I withdraw?</h4>
Taking part in this research study is your decision. Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to take part in this study, but if you do, you can stop at any time. Your decision whether to participate will not affect your relationship with Tufts University. There is no penalty if you do not participate. You have the right to choose not to participate in any study activity or completely withdraw from continued participation at any point in this study without penalty. If you withdraw from the study, the data collected to the point of withdrawal will be retained. You will be able to e-mail aabl_participants@cs.tufts.edu with your assigned MTurk worker ID to request that your data be deleted.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Can I be removed from the research without my OK?</h4>
We can remove you from the research study without your approval. Reasons we would do this include intentionally antagonistic interaction meant to disrupt learning.
